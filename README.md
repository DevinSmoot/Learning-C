# C Programming for Beginners

This repository was created to accompany the book C Programming for Beginners book (ISBN 9781516998357).

The code has been slightly expanded to provide feedback on inputs, clean up errors in the book's code, and the complete any incomplete code from the book.

This is merely a resource for aiding in helping beginners get started with programming in C.
